# async-tut1

This is my completed copy of David Nolan's [ClojureScript
101](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/11/07/clojurescript-101/) tutorial
covering [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).

The only difference is that I configured it to work with
[figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).

If you'd like to roll with the figwheel:

1. clone this
1. ```lein figwheel```, and
1. open up [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).
